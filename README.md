# homepage

A simple homepage to web browser. Sense look like a terminal, 
i would see where i can deep in :)

I will include some icons too. We'll see.

# Configuration

Edit `social-link.json`, you can find icon name to [ionicons.com](http://ionicons.com).

## Troubleshooting

With chrome, CORS policy block javascript unless you activate some obscur flag.  
I recommanded you to use [darkhttpd](https://unix4lyfe.org/darkhttpd/), he's light & secure (with chroot), if you are a gentoo user, i've wrote an ebuild [here](https://github.com/szorfein/ninjatools/blob/master/www-servers/darkhttpd/darkhttpd-1.12.ebuild).
